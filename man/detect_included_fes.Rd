}
\arguments{
\item{formulas}{A list of model formulas.}

\item{data}{The data frame containing the variables.}

\item{fe_symbol}{A character string representing the preferred symbol for the inclusion of fixed effects (e.g., "X" or "check").}

\item{get_var_label}{A function to retrieve the variable label.}
}
\value{
A list where each element corresponds to a fixed effect, containing the fixed effect label and symbols indicating inclusion in each specification.
